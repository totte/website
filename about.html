    <h1>About</h1>
	<h2>What is Chakra?</h2>
	<p>Chakra is a GNU/Linux distribution with an emphasis on KDE and Qt technologies that focuses on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">simplicity</a> from a technical standpoint and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a>.</p>
	<p>The goal is provide a fast, user-friendly and powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD">Live ISO</a> and Linux distribution specifically made for the <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> <a href="http://www.kde.org/workspaces/plasmadesktop">Plasma desktop</a>.</p>
	<p>With a new concept of <a href="https://chakraos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Chakra_Linux#The_Half-Rolling_Release_Model">half-rolling releases</a>, our <a href="wiki/index.php?title=Chakra_Tools">graphical tools</a> and a small but strong and diverse <a href="https://chakraos.org/forum/">community</a>, this is the computing environment you may have been waiting for!  It is especially made for those who truly want to learn something about Linux and yet not want to deal with excessive administrative overhead to enjoy the KDE Plasma desktop.</p>
	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>Chakra was born on the Internet, in a small shady corner of the <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode network</a>, where the KDEmod developers met one day and decided to create an awesome little Live ISO based on Arch Linux. Of course these goals had to be emphasized a little bit more, and soon after the initial thoughts and discussions we started to write up plans, schedules and develop like there is no tomorrow, while not forgetting the fun and keeping it relaxed. Chakra is our baby. A lot of efforts, time and countless hours of writing code and testing stuff have been put into it so far, but that was just the beginning.</p>
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>Our goal with Chakra is to provide an operating system for desktops that is easy to use, but still has all the functionality, clarity, power and speed of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> operating system. In the long term, we want to build an operating system that meets most requirements desktop users have today, like easy installation of software, graphical system administration, configuring power management on mobile devices or sharing an internet connection. To be better able to fulfill this goal, we strongly rely on users who report bugs, send in feature requests and ideas for improvements, and of course participate in development.</p>
	<p>Although this might sound like a distro for Linux newbies, these are not our only target audience, Chakra is made also for techy people and competent GNU/Linux users with a passion for KDE, KISS and such stuff, who don't fear to get their hands dirty but want to set up a usable desktop system quickly and easily.</p>
	<h2>Freedom</h2>
	<p>"Free software" is a matter of liberty, not just price. Chakra and all its appendant software and scripts are <a href="http://www.gnu.org">free software</a>, as in “free speech”, not as in “free beer”. We are proud to develop free software, because it makes a difference. However, to offer our users the smoothest possible experience we occasionally bend the rules and bundle proprietary drivers and software if no viable free alternative is available. As we also believe in choice, all proprietary software can be disabled at system startup (for drivers) and in our installer (for anything else).</p>
