<!--The Chakra Project is a community of KDE/Qt enthusiasts dedicated to providing a desktop-oriented operating system that is useful and enjoyable to everyone.
Chakra is a completely community driven distribution, where everyone is welcome to join and contribute. Everybody in our team will be happy to mentor you on your first steps, so don't hesitate to contact us! We strive to keep it easy to get involved by offering updated documentation on our tools and procedures and providing guidance to those interested in contributing.

The Chakra Experience
To trully appreciate the virtues of Chakra we urge you to use it for a while, as it offers much more than what can be included in a live image.There are several reasons that make Chakra stand appart as a distribution, the most notable ones being its focus on KDE/Qt software, the unique semi-rolling release model and our friendly community.

Chakra is a KDE centric distribution. We provide Plasma as the only available desktop environment, matched with a variety of KDE and Qt applications in our repositories. Our packages are stripped from their Gtk+ dependencies, but we offer the most popular Gtk+ based applications to our users.
The semi-rolling release model allows us to provide a distribution that is stable at its core components, yet provides all the latest applications and security updates to the user. This enables Chakra to be used in a range of environments, such as personal desktop systems, computer labs of schools as well as offices and small businesses.

Chakra and Arch
Chakra relies heavily on ArchLinux technologies but it is no longer compatible with the Arch repositories and packages. Chakra has its own repositories, buildsystem, toolchain and update schedule. Mixing repositories and installing binary packages from Arch is not recommended.

Work In Progress
Octopi is currently used as a GUI frontend for pacman in Chakra, but we plan to replace pacman in the near future with akabei, a new package manager developed by Chakra which will be optimized for GUI usage.

Chakra and Security
The Chakra Project install comes with ufw, which can be configured through system settings. The kernel is built with several MAC hardening options, including Tomoyo and AppArmor, and the 'tomoyo-tools' package is included to let the user configure this system. A third tool to handle security is Clam AntiVirus, which handles detection and removal of malware.
You can find more documentation on how to apply any of these tools on our wiki.-->

Chakra is a GNU/Linux distribution with an emphasis on KDE and Qt technologies, dedicated to providing a desktop-oriented operating system that is useful and enjoyable to the end user.

There are several reasons that make Chakra stand appart as a distribution, the most notable ones being:

Our focus on KDE/Qt software
Chakra is a KDE centric distribution. We provide Plasma as the only available desktop environment, matched with a variety of KDE and Qt applications in our repositories. Our packages are stripped from their Gtk+ dependencies, but we offer the most popular Gtk+ based applications to our users.

Our unique half-rolling repository system
This allows Chakra to provide a distribution that is a bit conservative at updating its core components (less time to worry about an update breaking your system due to a regression), yet provides all the latest applications and security updates to the user, together with immediate access to all the releases from KDE. As a result, Chakra has been reported to be used in a range of environments, such as personal desktop systems, computer labs of schools as well as offices and small businesses.

Our friendly community.
Chakra is a completely community driven distribution with a team of contributors of diverse backgrounds. Everyone is welcome to participate and help improve Chakra in their own way!

Our Arch Legacy
Chakra relies heavily on ArchLinux technologies which provide simplicity and transparency in the underlying system. This makes it easy to understand how your system works, how our repositories are built, and perhaps providing your own packages.  However, Chakra is not compatible with the Arch repositories and packages. We have our own repositories, buildsystem, toolchain and update schedule. Mixing repositories and installing binary packages from Arch is not recommended.

Chakra is a rolling distribution, so updating your installation will always get you all the available updates. Please keep an eye on the news to stay informed on package updates and changes.
To trully appreciate the virtues of Chakra we urge you to use it for a while, as it offers much more than what can be included in a live image.-->
