Don't phrase this in a way that makes it seem as if we are mooching off their brand, but make the origin (if necessary) and current independence clear. Arch Linux(tm) is still to be properly acknowledged in the credits/acknowledgements on another page. Make it clear that what we do is built from scratch - we don't copy other packages that have already been built into other repositories.</p>
