	<h1>Chakra Community Code of Conduct</h1>
	<h2>Preamble</h2>
	<p>In the Chakra community, participants from all over the world come together to create, distribute and make use of Free Software for the desktop. This is made possible by the support, hard work and enthusiasm of thousands of people, including those who create and use KDE software.</p>
	<p>This document offers some guidance to ensure Chakra participants can cooperate effectively in a positive and inspiring atmosphere, and to explain how together we can strengthen and support each other.</p>
	<p>This Code of Conduct is shared by all contributors and users who engage with the Chakra team and its community services.</p>

	<h2>Guidelines</h2>
	<p>This Code of Conduct presents a summary of the shared values and “common sense” thinking in our community. The basic social ingredients that hold our project together include:</p>
	<ul>
        <li>Be considerate</li>
        <li>Be respectful</li>
        <li>Be collaborative</li>
        <li>Be pragmatic</li>
        <li>Support others in the community</li>
        <li>Get support from others in the community</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Our community is made up of several groups of individuals and organizations which can roughly be divided into two groups:</p>
	<ul>
        <li>Contributors, or those who add value to the project through improving Chakra and KDE software as well as its services</li>
        <li>Users, or those who add value to the project through their support as consumers of Chakra and KDE software</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This Code of Conduct reflects the agreed standards of behavior for members of the Chakra community, in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, IRC channel, public meeting or private correspondence within the context of the Chakra team and its services. The community acts according to the standards written down in this Code of Conduct and will defend these standards for the benefit of the community. Leaders of any group, such as moderators of mailing lists, IRC channels, forums, etc., will exercise the right to suspend access to any person who persistently breaks our shared Code of Conduct.</p>

    <!-- BE CONSIDERATE -->
    <h3>Be considerate</h3>
	<p>Your actions and work will affect and be used by other people and you in turn will depend on the work and actions of others. Any decision you take will affect other community members, and we expect you to take those consequences into account when making decisions.</p>
	<p>As a contributor, ensure that you give full credit for the work of others and bear in mind how your changes affect others. It is also expected that you try to follow the development schedule and guidelines.</p>
	<p>As a user, remember that contributors work hard on their part of Chakra and KDE - and take great pride in it. If you are frustrated your problems are more likely to be resolved if you can give accurate and well-mannered information to all concerned.</p>
    <p>If an interpersonal issue arises, please be open-minded to the possibility that your behavior may have contributed to the problem. Taking responsibility for our actions is often a good first step toward a peaceful reconciliation.</p>

    <!-- BE RESPECTFUL -->
    <h3>Be respectful</h3>
	<p>In order for the Chakra community to stay healthy its members must feel comfortable and accepted. Treating one another with respect is absolutely necessary for this. In a disagreement, in the first instance assume that people mean well.</p>
	<p>We do not tolerate personal attacks, racism, sexism or any other form of discrimination. Disagreement is inevitable, from time to time, but respect for the views of others will go a long way to winning respect for your own view. Respecting other people, their work, their contributions and assuming well-meaning motivation will make community members feel comfortable and safe and will result in motivation and productivity.</p>
	<p>We expect members of our community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors, users and communities. Remember that Chakra is an international project and that you may be unaware of important aspects of other cultures.</p>
    <h4>Respect Other Users</h4>
    <p>Simply put, treat others as you would be treated; respect them and their views, even if you disagree with them.</p>
    <h4>Respect Other Distributions and Operating Systems</h4>
    <p>Maligning other GNU/Linux distributions, operating systems, or users thereof is prohibited. The entire Chakra team is happy to volunteer their time and energy to provide you with the Chakra distribution, documentation and forums. Kindly show respect toward the volunteers, users and communities of other distributions and operating systems as well. Views, experiences and opinions are always welcome, but unproductive slander is not.</p>

    <!-- BE COLLABORATIVE -->
    <h3>Be collaborative</h3>
	<p>The Free Software Movement depends on collaboration: it helps limit duplication of effort while improving the quality of the software produced. In order to avoid misunderstanding, try to be clear and concise when requesting help or giving it. Remember it is easy to misunderstand emails (especially when they are not written in your mother tongue). Ask for clarifications if unsure how something is meant; remember the first rule &mdash; assume in the first instance that people mean well.</p>
	<p>As a contributor, you should aim to collaborate with other community members, as well as with other communities that are interested in or depend on the work you do. Your work should be transparent and be fed back into the community when available, not just when Chakra or KDE releases. If you wish to work on something new in existing projects, keep those projects informed of your ideas and progress.</p>
	<p>It may not always be possible to reach consensus on the implementation of an idea, so don't feel obliged to achieve this before you begin. However, always ensure that you keep the outside world informed of your work, and publish it in a way that allows outsiders to test, discuss and contribute to your efforts.</p>
	<p>Contributors on every project come and go. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, you should do so with pride about what you have achieved and by acting responsibly towards others who come after you to continue the project.</p>
	<p>As a user, your feedback is important, as is its form. Poorly thought out comments can cause pain and the demotivation of other community members, but considerate discussion of problems can bring positive results. An encouraging word works wonders.</p>

    <!-- BE PRAGMATIC -->
    <h3>Be pragmatic</h3>
	<p>Chakra is a pragmatic community. We value tangible results over having the last word in a discussion. We defend our core values like freedom and respectful collaboration, but we don't let arguments about minor issues get in the way of achieving more important results. We are open to suggestions and welcome solutions regardless of their origin. When in doubt support a solution which helps getting things done over one which has theoretical merits, but isn't being worked on. Use the tools and methods which help getting the job done. Let decisions be taken by those who do the work.</p>

    <!-- SUPPORT OTHERS -->
    <h3>Support others in the community</h3>
	<p>Our community is made strong by mutual respect, collaboration and pragmatic, responsible behavior. Sometimes there are situations where this has to be defended and other community members need help.</p>
	<p>If you witness others being attacked, think first about how you can offer them personal support. If you feel that the situation is beyond your ability to help individually, go privately to the victim and ask if some form of official intervention is needed. Similarly you should support anyone who appears to be in danger of burning out, either through work-related stress or personal problems.</p>
	<p>When problems do arise, consider respectfully reminding those involved of our shared Code of Conduct as a first action. Leaders are defined by their actions, and can help set a good example by working to resolve issues in the spirit of this Code of Conduct before they escalate.</p>

    <!-- GET SUPPORT -->
    <h3>Get support from others in the community</h3>
	<p>Disagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time. Our community is no exception to the rule. The goal is not to avoid disagreements or differing views but to resolve them constructively. You should turn to the community to seek advice and to resolve disagreements and where possible consult the team most directly involved.</p>
	<p>Think deeply before turning a disagreement into a public dispute. If necessary request mediation, trying to resolve differences in a less highly-emotional medium. If you do feel that you or your work is being attacked, take your time to breathe through before writing heated replies. Consider a 24-hour moratorium if emotional language is being used &mdash; a cooling off period is sometimes all that is needed. If you really want to go a different way, then we encourage you to publish your ideas and your work, so that it can be tried and tested.</p>
    <h4>Life is a Two-way Street</h4>
    <p>A simple, yet profound and undeniable truth. Ensure your thread includes details and information that others will find useful. Share your findings with the community. Share your failures as well. Posting the equivalent of "Nevermind, I fixed it." in your thread or deleting your own posts for similar reasons is not only selfish and useless to the community, but a complete waste of resources and everyone's time.</p>
    <p>Also, demanding help or showing an obvious impatience toward getting it is unwanted here. Chakra is provided by a community of volunteers. Chakra users are strongly encouraged to do research, make an effort, report back in the thread, help others, get involved, and contribute to the community.</p>
    <p>Do not be a <a href="http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/">help vampire</a>.</p>

    <!-- FREEDOM AND CENSORSHIP -->
    <h3>Freedom</h3>
    The free and open exchange of assistance, speech, ideas and opinions is highly regarded and encouraged in the community, but it must be noted that the freedom granted to forum members is <i>relative freedom</i>. It exists within the boundaries of the in this document listed guidelines, policies and principles. Complaints of censorship are therefore baseless and unfounded, since this necessary framework must simultaneously provide reasonable limitations. To illustrate, we are aware of the physical laws which govern energy and matter, yet we do not complain of their oppression. Instead, we recognize that such laws are essential for our welfare. Likewise, the Chakra community's high standards reflected in these guidelines regulate community freedom for the common good and protection of all. The key, then, to true freedom on the forums is to cultivate benevolence toward others and harmonize our attitude with the Chakra by bringing only benefit to our peers. In addition, this allows members to satisfy all contributory impulses without aggravating themselves or encroaching on the freedom of others. Embracing the above principles and obeying the forum guidelines therefore benefits the entire community by providing freedom from the harmful and negative consequences of a more chaotic approach.

    <!-- POLICIES -->
    <h2>Policies</h2>

    <!-- HOW TO POST ON THE FORUM -->
    <h3>Posting on the forum</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Choose clear, informative subject lines.</b> This is more likely to elicit response from experienced users who have knowledge about that particular topic. It also makes the topic easy to reference and find in forum searches by future users with similar problems. Further, avoid extraneous phrases such as "Help", "Urgent", "Recent update" etc.
        <ul>
            <li>Examples of <i>good</i> subject lines:
            <ul>
                <li>"XSane: Failed to open device: Invalid argument"</li>
                <li>"pptp vpn fails to connect: Couldn't set pass-filter in kernel: Invalid"</li>
                <li>"Akonadi error, MySQL - unsupported storage engine: innodb"</li>
                <li>"Calibre: Qt platform plugin 'xcb' not found (yet listed as available)"</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Examples of <i>bad</i> subject lines:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>"I have internet but cant connect!!!!"</li>
                <li>"installing chakra"</li>
                <li>"recent update"</li>
                <li>"It's an emergency ! Plasma crash"</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A sincere effort to use modest and <b>proper language and grammar</b> is a sign of respect toward the community that will certainly be appreciated and is quite likely to elicit positive responses. Please refrain from using so-called "textspeak", "netspeak", "leetspeak" and all other forms of internet slang.</li>
        <li>When asking questions, <b>provide as much information as possible</b>, including error messages, terminal output, logs, what you have previously tried, what documentation and searches you have attempted, and related configuration files.</li>
        <li>Choose <b>one (1) issue per topic</b>. Long topics are discouraged in the technical issue subforums and tend to be difficult to follow.</li>
        <li>Post your question in one subforum; pick the most relevant, and post there:
        <ul>
            <li>If your question is an open-ended discussion (and <i>not</i> something you need help with) - post it in <a href="https://chakraos.org/forum/viewforum.php?id=18">General/Discussion</a>.</li>
            <li>If your question is a request for <i>help</i>, post it in:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://chakraos.org/forum/viewforum.php?id=54">Support/Beginner</a> if you aren't sure where to post (include your pacman configuration file, <b>/etc/pacman.conf</b>, so that it is clear which repositories you have enabled)</li>
                <li><a href="https://chakraos.org/forum/viewforum.php?id=32">Support/Stable</a> if you are only using the stable repositories (<a href="https://chakraos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Terminology#.5Bcore.5D">[core]</a>, <a href="https://chakraos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Terminology#.5Bdesktop.5D">[desktop]</a>, <a href="https://chakraos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Terminology#.5Bgtk.5D">[gtk]</a> and <a href="https://chakraos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Terminology#.5Blib32.5D">[lib32]</a>).</li>
                <li><a href="https://chakraos.org/forum/viewforum.php?id=45">Support/Testing</a> if you have enabled the <a href="https://chakraos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Terminology#.5Btesting.5D">[testing]</a> repository.</li>
                <li><a href="https://chakraos.org/forum/viewforum.php?id=63">Support/Unstable</a> if you have enabled the <a href="https://chakraos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Terminology#.5Bunstable.5D">[unstable]</a> repository.</li>
                <li><a href="https://chakraos.org/forum/viewforum.php?id=36">Support/Live Media & Installation</a> if you are having trouble when running the live media or installing Chakra.</li>
                <li><a href="https://chakraos.org/forum/viewforum.php?id=39">Support/Hardware</a> if you are having a hardware-specific issue. Don't forget to include information about which repositories you have enabled.</li>
                <li><a href="https://chakraos.org/forum/viewforum.php?id=35">Support/CCR</a> if your question is about building packages or using the CCR.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When responding to an existing topic, always read the original post and stick to the subject.</li>
        <li>Finally, when a solution is found, <b>mark your topic as solved</b> by editing the first post and <i>prepending</i> [SOLVED] to the title in the "Subject" field. Do <i>not</i> use [CLOSED], since this is used by the forum software to mark a topic which is no longer accessible for new posts.</li>
        <li>If a topic is marked as [SOLVED], do not reply stating the equivalent of "I am having a similar issue.."; <b>create a new topic</b> and link to the [SOLVED] topic, if it is relevant.</li>

    </ul>

    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <h3>Command output and code</h3>
    <p>Use <code>[code]</code> tags when pasting command output and/or code. Example: <code>[code]command output goes here[/code]</code></p>
    <p>Non-English locale users: prepend <code>LC_ALL=C</code>  to posted commands so that the output will be in English.</p>
    <p>How to make use of the formatting is covered with examples <a href="https://chakraos.org/forum/help.php">here</a>.</p>

    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <h3>Pictures</h3>
    <p>Do not post full screen pictures; use thumbnails instead. Any image with dimensions greater than 250x250px or over 50Kb in size will be edited or removed. Always keep in mind that there are many whom have metered bandwidth.</p>

    <!-- BEHAVIOUR -->
    <h3>Trolling</h3>
    <p>A "troll" is a person who intentionally attempts to disrupt, cause controversy, incite an argument, and/or receive negative attention by deliberately posting provocative content. The term may also refer to the act of posting such content, or the content itself.</p>
    <p>Trolls are generally deceitful and often use ambivalence as a method of covertly insulting, intimidating, or inciting a person or persons for their own sadistic pleasure. They often pick their words very carefully and are therefore able to defend their masked attempts at creating unrest, frequently redirecting the blame onto the community and its supposed failure to understand them properly. Trolling is strictly prohibited.</p>

    <!-- BEHAVIOUR -->
    <h3>Powerposting</h3>
    <p>Powerposting is best described as posting empty and worthless messages. It is not tolerated. People may have two reasons to do this: to increase their post count meaninglessly, or to lend support to an idea as if it were a vote. Examples of power-posting include, but are not limited to, replying with "+1", "lol", "me too", "I agree", or ":)".</p>
    <p>When posting or replying to messages, <b>make sure you have something to say</b>. These empty posts clutter up threads and discussion, invalidate the 'Show New Posts' function, and waste bandwidth and server space.</p>
    <p>Threads that degenerate into a series of "+1/-1" or "me too/I agree/I disagree" will be locked. Individual power posts may also be deleted.</p>

    <!-- BEHAVIOUR -->
    <h3>Bumping</h3>
    <p>Posting a single word or useless message (bumping) to attract attention to your thread is not allowed. Do your own research, continue to troubleshoot, post the results, and be patient with the community. If people are reading your thread without answering or offering help, you may try supplying more details, or ask to be pointed in the right direction. Often, the reason for posts remaining unanswered is due in large part to the sparse details in the original post itself, or, the obvious availability of solutions in the wiki, on the forum or on the web, and the community's unwillingness to point out the obvious.</p>

    <!-- BEHAVIOUR -->
    <h3>Necrobumping</h3>
    <p>Do your part to keep the forums tidy and relevant. Posting in old threads (older than six months), or "necrobumping" is discouraged in the technical issue fora, since it can potentially create disjointed "zombie" information; outdated posts with data which is no longer relevant due to Chakra's rolling nature, combined with more recent posts reflecting more current circumstance. Furthermore, technical support threads should remain succinct, and multiple pages are to be avoided if possible.</p>
    <h4>Rules of thumb</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If you have a question, start a new thread and link to the old if relevant.</li>
        <li>If you have something to add and judge that your information is related, but more up-to-date, start a new thread and link to the old if desired, but avoid duplicating effort by posting information already contained in the Chakra wiki.</li>
        <li>If you have a version-agnostic or corresponding solution, necrobumping <i>might</i> be appropriate.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- BEHAVIOUR -->
    <h3>Misplaced Posts</h3>
    <p>Try to place your posts in the correct forum for the topic. Our forum has been carefully categorized so that most topics fit in one, logical location. Any post that is deemed by the staff to be in the wrong forum will be moved to the correct location without warning. Most users can find these on their own but if you lose your thread, it is acceptable to contact one of the forum advisers asking where it has been moved. For questions, send an e-mail to moderators@chakraos.org. Do <i>not</i> create new topics asking about why another topic was moved or where it was moved to.</p>

    <!-- BEHAVIOUR -->
    <h3>Thread Hijacking</h3>
    <p>Thread hijacking is the process of replying to an existing thread with a different topic. This is discouraged. It is better to start a new thread if you have a problem that is related to an existing posted issue but clearly different. Posts that hijack a serious thread with off-topic discussion are also discouraged.</p>

    <!-- BEHAVIOUR -->
    <h3>Flaming</h3>
    <p>Flaming, in the most common sense definition, is directing negative, disrespectful, and/or insulting comments toward someone. An equally or more negative response, resulting in a cycling exchange of insults is often the consequence. Flaming fellow members (including the Chakra community) will not be tolerated. Never resort to personal insults and please avoid sarcastic and patronizing language. <i>Discussions can be productive, but quarreling is always destructive.</i></p>

    <!-- BEHAVIOUR -->
    <h3>Respect The Staff</h3>
    <p>The moderators have been chosen for their ability to exercise consistently good judgment and shall have the final say. Note that this forum is <i>not</i> run as a democracy. The moderators shall always attempt to implement universally peaceful solutions, but in the end, are charged with the responsibility of maintaining peaceful, civil order for the forum majority. Therefore, they cannot always please everyone with the decisions made. Please do your part to contribute to a healthy community and environment.</p>
    <p>If you feel that an egregious oversight has been made, do NOT post complaints in forum topics - they will be closed. Instead, use the forum report function or send an e-mail to moderators@chakraos.org.</p>

    <!-- PROCOTOLS -->
    <h2>Protocols</h2>
    <h3>Forum Bikeshed protocol</h3>
    <p>Read <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/mailing-list-faq/bikeshed.html">this</a> for more information. The following types of topics will be <i>moved</i> to <b>Archive/Bikeshed</b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Product recommendation requests</li>
        <li>Questions about when X will be available or released</li>
        <li>Ponderous, opinion-based topics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Threads stating the equivalent of "there is a problem with the Chakra system and methodology, we need to discuss it" have been repeatedly proven ineffective and inflammatory and will usually be closed after a warning from the moderation team. Chakra is a community where you are expected to read some manuals and <i>get your hands dirty</i> from time to time. If you have identified a system issue, find a solution that works for you, implement it, then, if it is fitting a tutorial, make it available in the wiki.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, questioning or discussing the methods used by the Chakra developers and packagers will be monitored closely and locked <i>if deemed unhelpful and/or unproductive</i>. Harsh, unproductive criticism is also uncalled for.</p>
    <p>If you have a question regarding Chakra development, please ensure that your topic poses a specific question and be open-minded to responses. If possible, provide a solution or partial solution. Submitting code and patches for discussion is always more pragmatic than asking others to do it for you.</p>

    <!-- EXPANDED FROM LIST -->
    <h4>Explained: Product recommendation requests</h4>
    <p>Threads seeking advice about computer product recommendations are discouraged. Such topics, like the technology they discuss, quickly become obsolete and are unlikely to provide any lasting benefit to the wider community. These topics will therefore be moved to Archive/Bikeshed, permitting replies but staying unindexed by search engines. You are expected to be able to do your own research and draw your own conclusions about which product best suits your individual requirements.</p>

    <h3>Forum Dustbin protocol</h3>
    <p>The following types of topics will be <i>closed</i> and <i>moved</i> to <b>Archive/Dustbin</b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spam</li>
        <li>Duplicates</li>
        <li>Redundant (topics already posted about or reported in the bugtracker)</li>
        <li>Offensive</li>
        <li>Solicitation</li>
        <li>Adverts</li>
        <li>Reports of outdated or broken packages (report such issues on the bugtracker)</li>
        <li>Reports of website issues (report such issues on the bugtracker)</li>
        <li>Personal inquiries regarding accounts or services (send an e-mail to webmaster@chakraos.org for assistance)</li>
        <li>Personal messages</li>
        <li>Rants</li>
        <li>Tutorials (add documentation and instructions to the wiki - it exists for this very purpose)</li>
        <li>Controversial topics such as politics, sports and religion</li>
        <li>Requests for help with other distributions than Chakra, or packages built for other distributions</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- EXPANDED FROM LIST -->
    <h4>Explained: Spam</h4>
    <p>A blight upon the face of the net, spam is forbidden. Please report spam with the forum report function and a moderator will review it for removal. Offending spam accounts and associated IP addresses will be banned. Do not reply to spam posts as it increases the amount of work required to clean them up.</p>

    <!-- EXPANDED FROM LIST -->
    <h4>Explained: Reports of outdated or broken packages and website issues</h4>
    <p>The forum is <i>not</i> an issue tracker or bugtracker, nor is it a replacement for e-mail. It is primarily intended for support in the form of questions and answers. The appropriate way to report any specific issue is to do it in the bugtracker which will automatically notify the relevant people (be it developers or packagers). The bugtracker also allows for one or more person to take ownership of a reported issue, change its status and finally close the issue depending on the outcome of the procedure. In addition to this only a few packagers and developers actively browse the forum, meaning that e.g. a report of an outdated package there may not be seen at all until someone reports it in the bugtracker.</p>

    <!-- EXPANDED FROM LIST -->
    <h4>Explained: Personal Topics and Rants</h4>
    <p>Rants and rude complaints are frowned upon and will be closed as they are discovered. Posts of this type are much better suited for a blog or other personal web space and are unwanted on the Chakra forum. Public posts should be open, productive and inviting to all members.  Discussions among a select group of users should take place in private message.</p>

    <!-- EXPANDED FROM LIST -->
    <h4>Explained: Controversial Topics</h4>
    <p>There is no explicit list of topics considered to be "trollish", controversial or provocative, but in the past, threads with posts pertaining to <b>Religion, Sports, Race, Nationalism</b> and <b>Politics</b> have invariably been closed. Therefore, <b>specifically avoid these and all divisive topics on the Chakra forum!</b> The forum staff certainly realizes that such issues are deeply ingrained human realities. However, this is a GNU/Linux distribution forum, and thus neither intended nor able to effectively facilitate such commentary nor the resulting unrest.</p>

    <!-- EXPANDED FROM LIST -->
    <h4>Explained: Homework</h4>
    <p>As a matter of principle, do not ask for homework answers, nor post answers to such requests. Homework assignments are designed to encourage a student to learn by their own personal research.  Topics deemed to be about homework will be closed.</p>

    <!-- EXPANDED FROM LIST -->
    <h4>Explained: Advertising/Solicitation</h4>
    <p>Publicity for a cause or the promotion of goods and/or services will be monitored closely. Generally, if it is related to Chakra (as a project or community) or GNU/Linux/FOSS, it will usually be allowed. Web-invites, plugging, blog-type or commercial promotions are typically discouraged, or outright prohibited. If unsure about the appropriateness of your content, contact the moderation team <i>before</i> posting by sending an e-mail to moderators@chakraos.org. No links to commercial pages are allowed in signatures or the website field in ones profile, only to personal blogs or open source pages.</p>

    <!-- EXPANDED FROM LIST -->
    <h4>Explained: Chakra Distribution Support ONLY</h4>
    <p>Chakra is not based on any other distribution. It often uses different packages, package versions, repositories, and has custom system configurations surreptitiously, not compatible with Arch Linux or Arch Linux-based distributions.  Receiving support for such projects is near to impossible on the Chakra forum. Community technical support shall only be provided for the Chakra distribution and the Chakra Community Repository. Threads concerning issues with, and requesting support for, derivate distributions, or operating systems other than Chakra will under most circumstances be closed.</p>

    <h4>Explained: Crossposting</h4>
    <p>Crossposting is posting about the same subject in multiple places. This is a waste of resources and is not permitted. Any crossposted topic will be closed and moved to the Dustbin.</p>

    <h4>Explained: Legality</h4>
    <p><a href="http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/criminal-solicitation/">Criminal solicitation</a> is strictly forbidden on this website. In this context, "criminal solicitation" shall mean, "To actively or passively inform about, facilitate, incite, move, or persuade others to some act of lawlessness or illegal activity."</p>
    <p>Therefore, do not post discussions about or link to criminal solicitation in any form. This includes, but is not limited to information or links to facilitate illegal drug use, theft, network intrusion, creation of code for malignant purposes, prohibited software copying, prohibited use of copyrighted/patented material, so-called "warez", or sites which provide torrents or links to such content. Illegal content will be removed swiftly and dealt with in full accordance with known applicable law.</p>

    <!-- SUSPENSION PROTOCOL -->
    <h3>Suspension protocol</h3>
    <p>If the moderators feel that a member's behaviour is unacceptable and warrants intervention, a warning will typically be issued unless the occurrence is judged to be especially flagrant, in which case a ban may become imminent. Warnings will not be discussed on the Chakra forum, IRC channels, or mailing lists by the moderators. If the warning goes unheeded, further action will be taken. This may range from a temporary ban of the offending user account, to a permanent ban, out of consideration for a peaceful forum and community. Action is generally on a case-by-case basis.</p>
    <p>If a user is apologetic, interested in a peaceful solution and wishes to have their account reinstated, a general consensus will be formed by the moderators for, or against, such a request.</p>
    <p>If you have been warned or banned and feel that it is in error, you may send an e-mail to moderators@chakraos.org to discuss the issue.</p>

    <!-- USER FORUM ACCOUNTS PROTOCOL -->
    <h3>Account protocol</h3>
    <p>Limit your forum membership to one account only. Having multiple accounts is an unnecessary use of resources. Further, it may be interpreted as trolling behavior. Selecting a username, e.g. "chakradeveloper", that could be interpreted as someone of an official stance will be changed. Impersonation is not allowed.</p>
    <p>Neither username changes nor account deletion requests will be considered. There is no streamlined method in place to expedite such a task, and to do so requires an unpleasant amount of work for the administration.</p>

    <!-- CONTRIBUTOR ACCOUNTS PROTOCOL -->
    <h3>Contributor Server Account protocol</h3>
    <p>Shell and git access, accounts are locked but not deleted after six months of inactivity.</p>
    <p>A valid e-mail address must be given and used for communication with the administration.</p>
    <p>Internal announcements mailing list?</p>
    <p>It is strongly recommended, but not strictly required, that contributors subscribe to the mailing lists (link) and join the IRC development channel, since this is where most discussions concerning packaging, development etc. take place.</p>
